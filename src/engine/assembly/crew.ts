/**
 * A first crew for the orders that have none.
 *
 * A fresh export carries no allocation — `Planning1.csv` says what to build,
 * never who builds it — and an order with nobody on it has no duration, so it
 * has no bar, no Expect Date and no share of the load. Eighty such orders is
 * not a schedule, and staffing them one at a time is not a morning's work.
 *
 * So: hand every unstaffed order a crew drawn from the operators currently
 * placed on its line, preferring matching skills and trades. Remaining labour
 * determines team size, with three people preferred for table assembly.
 * The supervisor can adjust the result. It only ever *adds*: an
 * order somebody has already crewed is left exactly as it is.
 *
 * Pure. No React, no store.
