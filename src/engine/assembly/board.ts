/**
 * Derives the assembly Gantt: one row per order, grouped by line.
 *
 * ## Where a bar starts
 *
 * As early as it can. Every order asks for today and is pushed out only by
 * something real: a component another order is still making, material that has
 * not landed, a crew still on something else, or a line with no build position
 * free. Nothing waits for the day Epicor pencilled in — that date is worked
 * back from the due date and is a *deadline*, which the board carries as `Must
 * start` rather than as an instruction to stand idle until then.
 *
 * A line is not a single station: it has several build positions, so up to
 * `line.parallelOrders` orders run side by side, and only when every position
 * is busy does an order queue behind whichever frees first. What decides who
 * gets the position, and the people, is how much slack an order has left —
 * `urgency`, the day it must start to still make its due date. A bar the
 * planner dragged keeps its day regardless: a drag is an instruction.
 *
 * ## What waits for what
 *
 * `JobMaterialReq.csv` says which components each order consumes, and
 * `engine/assembly/dependencies` turns those into the orders that build them.
 * An order starts no earlier than the last of them finishes — so a chair on
 * ASSY sits behind its cover on UPL and its shell on a moulding press, and
 * pulling any of those forward pulls the chair forward with it.
 *
 * ## Who waits for whom
 *
 * The other chain is the people. Nobody builds two orders at once, so an order
 * whose crew is still on something else begins when the last of them is
 * free — and begins *exactly* then, not on whatever day Epicor pencilled in.
 * That is how the floor actually runs: a team finishes one order and picks up
 * the next the same shift, so the board shows neither the overlap of two bars
 * sharing a person nor the idle days between them.
 *
 * A crew coming free is the one constraint that rounds to the next shift: a
 * day is charged as a whole shift, and one person cannot work two of them.
 * Everything else lands on the day it happens — a component finished at eleven
 * in the morning is finished at eleven in the morning, and the order waiting on
 * it starts that day, which is what keeps a chain of steps tight rather than
 * spending a day at each link.
 *
 * ## Where a bar ends
 *
 * Its length is the remaining work divided by the crew on it, so allocating
 * another person visibly shortens it. Those are *working* days: the factory is
 * shut at the weekend, so a bar steps over Saturday and Sunday unless the
 * supervisor has approved overtime on that order. The end of the bar is the
 * Expect Date, which is what the colour bands compare against Ship and Due —
 * past Due is red, and Due itself never moves from here.
 *
 * Pure — same shape as `computeBoardView` for moulding.
