 * a day must be on the bench by the middle of the last day, and saying so is
 * the difference between a date that can be acted on and one that cannot. The
 * export's own value stays visible beside it as a cross-check — a gap means
 * the crew size or the hours differ from whatever Epicor assumed.
 *
