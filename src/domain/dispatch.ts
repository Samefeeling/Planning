/**
 * Dispatch (outbound logistics) domain: what a waybill order is, how each
 * delivery zone is routed, and the equipment each route ships in.
 *
 * Three ways an order leaves the factory, decided by the waybill's
 * `Description` (the delivery zone):
 *
 * - **NSW delivery** — a contractor's truck, booked for the run, delivers to
 *   the customer (there is no own fleet: every load is booked). Orders for
 *   nearby customers in the same zone and Ship Via share a run; an order is
 *   only split when it is bigger than the biggest truck. A run of a pallet or
 *   two is booked as a part load instead of a truck.
 * - **Interstate linehaul** — orders are consolidated per delivery zone and
 *   carrier (`Description` + `Ship Via`, e.g. `QLD- Metro` / `AQMC`) and
 *   trucked to the state's hub city; the local carrier there does the last
 *   mile. Different carriers or zones never share a departure. A departure is
 *   a full truck (FTL) or, when small, a part load (LTL).
 * - **Export containers** — consolidated per destination into FCL containers,
 *   or LCL when too small to fill one. Volume decides the container count, so
 *   fill is shown on every container.
 *
 * Customer pickup orders are only scheduled for the dock, never loaded.
