/**
 * The board's one row of chrome, and the only one it has.
 *
 * It reads left to right as a question and its answer. **Show** is what the
 * board is being asked to draw — which lines, which columns, which days — and
 * the one thing that adds to the board rather than narrowing it. **Timeline**
 * is how far the days are zoomed. Then the figures: what is on the board, what
 * is nearly due, how much of the roster is spoken for, and what is waiting to
 * be looked at.
 *
 * Controls to the left, figures to the right, and nothing in the middle that is
 * both. The board used to open with a band above this one carrying its name,
 * its source and two of these counts — and inside MES that band sat under a top
 * bar already naming it. There is no identity band now; what is left of it is
 * the source and its read time, beside the button that re-reads them.
