/**
 * The weekend question.
 *
 * Saturday and Sunday are closed, so a bar dropped on one is not written
 * straight to the plan: paying a crew to come in is the supervisor's call, and
 * this is where they make it. Until they answer, the order stays exactly where
 * it was — the drag has changed nothing.
 *
 * Three answers, and each of them is an answer:
 *   Confirm   run it at the weekend, marked as overtime on the board
 *   Monday    keep the move, land it on the next working day instead
 *   Cancel    leave the order where it was
